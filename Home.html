<p><table><tr><th><div id="e1" class="info"><FONT Color="Black" size="+1" align="left"> Every society has its own cultural festival or event to which they are proud of and ascribe to. In Kebbi State, the Argungu Fishing Festival is an annual event which is famous, not only in the state but internationally.

Kebbi Kingdom, according to history, was founded by a famous warrior called Mohammadu Kanta in 1515. He conquered many and his neighbouring states to build the kingdom which stretched as far as Adar, Azben, Borgu, Ibadan, Kano, Katsina, Nupe, Oyo, Oshogbo, Ogbomosho, Zazzau and Zamfara. He used his great influence and power to build the city of his surname as capital for the kingdom and reigned 46 years, until he died as a result of wounds sustained from an arrow shoot in

Dan Asita, Ingawa District of Katsina State and was burried at Takwachal Bengi on January 25, 1561.Argungu is synonymous with fishing and, historically, the fishing festival in the ancient kingdom dates back to 1934 when the then emir Mohammadu Sama or ‘Sarkin Kabbi’, as he was popularly called, organised a fishing ceremony to welcome the Sultan of Sokoto, Hassan Muazu – a Fulani king who was the first sultan to have visited and slept in Argungu, inspite of the rivalry between the Fulani and Kabawa tribes. This rivalry later resulted to fierce battles on the battle field for many years.

However, as a result of this historic visit to Argungu, the emir felt that the best way to receive and honour his high-profile guest was for his people – who were great fishermen, by the way – to arrange for the fishing festival to honour the Sultan, using their ancestral traditional occupation which is fishing. The visiting Sultan was treated to a grand fishing festival and, from that time on, the fishing festival continued to blossom. Today, it has become an international event, one which is honoured by tourists from all over the world and the country, people who want to see the wonderful culture of Kabbawa on display.

 event is symbolic, because it fosters peace and unity between Fulanis and Kabawas who have been fighting each other for centuries.

“You see, at that time, both Fulanis and Kabawas were at loggerheads, fighting each other but the fishing festival was able to bring about peace between both kingdoms. It even resulted in marriages between them.For example, this brought about the marriage between the families of the late emir of Argungu, Mohammadu Mera and the late Sultan Abubakar III,” Makwashi said.

The overseer also revealed that the fishing festival has also contributed to the economic betterment of the area and its people, besides its diverse cultural significance. He also believes that the fishing festival exalts the locality Argungu which also facilitated the securing of Kebbi as a state from the former Sokoto State in 1991. “Argungu became popular, as people everywhere and from all parts of the world came for the fishing festival. As a result, local people became rich, businesses blossomed and the state Kebbi State was formed. The government has also constructed huge bridges across the rivers and roads for us to go anywhere we wish to. When you look at farming, as well, the river has helped us in the production of rice which we even farm in the dry season. The government is even proud of us and what we do,” he added.

Makwashi also revealed the procedure of the festival. According to him, the fishermen from Kabbi and other parts of the country gather during the grand finale. When they are ushered into the river they all rush in and take strategic positions. They begin to fish after a signal is given and stop when the organisers feel that the fishing is over.

After the fishes have been weighed, the weightiest catch is then identified and awarded the first prize. Other events which add colour and glamour to the event before the final fishing are wrestling, local boxing (dambe), archery, agricultural show (display of different food crops and domestic animals), fish-butchering, canoeing, diving, cultural dances and singing, ‘kabanci’ displays (catching of birds and fingerlings with bare hands) without nets and, finally, the grand fishing which sums up everything and brings the festival to a close.
